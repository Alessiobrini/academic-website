I am a faculty member at Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering, where I work with the Digital Asset Research & Engineering Collaborative (DAREC). My research and teaching focus on financial challenges in digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi), with a strong emphasis on applied machine learning and data science. I work across the full spectrum of machine learning — supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning — to develop models that advance our understanding of complex financial systems.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Finance from Scuola Normale Superiore, where I focused on reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making in finance. My dissertation, *Reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making: a data-driven approach for finance*, reflects my ongoing interest in the intersection of finance, technology, and computation.

At Duke, I teach courses including Machine Learning for FinTech, Data Wrangling and Visualization with Python, and Introduction to Statistics in the Master of Engineering in Financial Technology program. I also mentor students on FinTech capstone projects and guide summer research initiatives.

My research has been presented at conferences and circulated as working papers, covering topics such as cryptocurrency market stability and reinforcement learning for financial trading. Beyond teaching and research, I serve as a reviewer for academic journals, contribute to conference organizations, and advise graduate students.
