I am an **Executive in Residence** at Duke University’s Pratt School of Engineering, where I work with the Digital Asset Research & Engineering Collaborative ([DAREC](https://darec.duke.edu)). My research and teaching focus on financial challenges in digital assets and decentralized finance, with a strong emphasis on applied machine learning and data science. I work across the full spectrum of machine learning — supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning — to develop models that advance our understanding of complex financial systems.

At Duke, I teach courses including *Machine Learning for FinTech*, *Data Wrangling and Visualization with Python*, and *Introduction to Statistics* in the [Master of Engineering in Financial Technology program](https://masters.pratt.duke.edu/fintech/). I also mentor students on FinTech capstone projects and guide summer research initiatives.  

Prior to my current role, I was a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the same department at Duke since January 2022.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Finance from [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en), where I focused on reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making in finance. My dissertation, [*Reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making: a data-driven approach for finance*](https://tesidottorato.depositolegale.it/handle/20.500.14242/167041), reflects my ongoing interest in the intersection of finance, technology, and computation.
