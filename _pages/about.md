I am an **Executive in Residence** at Duke Universityâ€™s Pratt School of Engineering, working with the [Digital Asset Research & Engineering Collaborative (DAREC)](https://darec.duke.edu). I work on **machine learning applications in finance and economics**, with a strong emphasis on challenges in **decentralized finance** and **digital assets**.  

At Duke, I teach *Machine Learning for FinTech*, *Data Wrangling and Visualization with Python*, and *Introduction to Statistics and Econometrics* in the [Master of Engineering in Financial Technology program](https://masters.pratt.duke.edu/fintech/). I also mentor students on FinTech capstones and summer research projects.  

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Finance from [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/en), where I studied reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making in finance. My dissertation, [*Reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making: a data-driven approach for finance*](https://tesidottorato.depositolegale.it/handle/20.500.14242/167041), reflects my ongoing interest in the intersection of finance, technology, and computation.
